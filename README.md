# Super Mario Land disassembly

Disassembly of the first Game Boy game I ever played

This repository builds Super Mario Land (World) (Rev A) with SHA1 checksum `418203621b887caa090215d97e3f509b79affd3e`

As of now it requires a copy of the original ROM named "baserom.gb" to be placed in the repository

Requires RGBDS to build
